CYBITS+GPUNK CODE OF CONDUCT

This is my geepunk. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My geepunk is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must
master my life.

Without me, my geepunk is useless. Without my geepunk, I am useless. I
must fire my geepunk true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is
trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will...

My geepunk and I know that what counts in war is not the rounds we
fire, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know that it
is the hits that count. We will hit...

My geepunk is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will
learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its
parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. I will keep my
geepunk clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become
part of each other. We will...

Before God, I swear this creed. My geepunk and I are the defenders of
my country. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my
life.

So be it, until victory is Gondola's and there is no enemy, but peace!
