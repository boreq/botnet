What's that Can't tell Hand held dream Shot in hell Deep space ghetto (streets) Show me somethin' I ain't seen before Mystery hind that Death door Juke step electrocute the floor What's the science on Flyin' that high Got a no-no goin', one time
Creeps up behind me Over my shoulder Turn around try to see But it's nowhere Noided, noided Static on my blindside
I seen footage, I stay noided... I seen footage [repeat]
Everybody's knowin' Where ya think you're goin' ain't goin' nowhere Satellite, handle that Wit a lead pipe
Who captures life Who takes what's left who stay On that next, already know my gillicutti, like I told you...  Don't touch me What's up wit it I stay noided, stimulation overload account for it Desensitized by the mass amounts of shit
I've seen it, I've been it Can't delete it feels like jail (noided) Full moon in da klink shinin' don't sleep Surveillance post my bail
I seen footage, I stay noided... I seen footage [repeat]
Armored cop open fire Glock On some kid who stepped so Fast was hard to grasp What even happened til you seen dat head blow Off his shoulders in slow mo Rewind that, is so cold Rewind that, is so cold I seen footage... I stay noided
Juke step wit so much boy rude looseness seem like no bones in his skin (Noided) my jaw hit da floor like this real for I gotta see that one mo gin
Ambulance hit and run over pedestrian in Brazil Little tiger, boy soldier Twist a cap back and kills (noided)
Seen crazy shit, man crazy shit...
I seen footage, I stay noided... I seen footage I close my eyes and seize it I clench my fists and beat it I light my torch and burn it I am the beast I worship...
And I know soon come my time For in mine void a pale horse burns But I fear not the time I'm taken Past the point of no return.  Wage war like no tomorrow Cuz no hell there won't be one For all who deny the struggle The triumphant overcome
Trips to where, few have been Out of thin air, upon high winds Rites begin when the sun descends Have felt what few will ever know Have seen the truth beneath the glow, Of the ebb and flow, where roots of all mysteries grow I am below, so far below The bottom line
Transmitting live, transmissions rise From the depths out of controlled by Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes Imminent gaze cast 'pon the path that winds 'Pon the path I find, and claim as mine To ride the waves, of unrest Made to make me shine as a testament To why the ways of the blind will never get
Shit but shanked by my disrespect Dismiss this life, worship death Cold blood night of serpent's breath Exhaled like spells from the endlessness In the bottomless wells of emptiness Channeled to invoke what we represent
Secret order Elitist horde of Creeping fire Seizing power Riders of the lupus hour Eye on palm Time is gone Moonlight drawn Fly til dawn Sacrifice to rise beyond Deep inside the violent calm Of the coming storm In blood sworn To glorify and for life adorn With all that dies to become unborn
I close my eyes and seize it I clench my fists and beat it I light my torch and burn it I am the beast I worship...  I am the beast I worship
In the time before time eyes 'bove which horns Curve like psychotropic scythes And smell of torn flesh bled dry By hell swarms of pestis flies Vomiting forth flames lit by An older than ancient force That slays this life with no remorse
The spiral storm Of flames inside The torch I raise The force I ride
Feel my vessel go up in flames Flesh torch lit by thee unnamed Direct connection to the source Vestment of unnatural force Forever burning black torch Wisdom of the old and true Possessed by the chosen few Shining to reveal the ways Of a darkness that pervades All that is and ever was Inferno of witches blood
Worship is not on bended knee Nature knows not of mercy To pray is to accept defeat Power pisses on the weak Bow and beheaded by the beast Beggar on a bitches leash Scum is desperate for relief Worship is the way I ride Witching currents through the eye Of storms that force the false to die Worship the flames with which I rise Into apocalyptic skies
Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone In splintered skeleton I roam Wastelands with not to call my own But the path I walk alone The hunger burns, within my gut As my bones turn into dust
And I know soon come my time For in mine void a pale horse burns But I fear not the time I'm taken Past the point of no return Wage war like no tomorrow, know well there wont we one For all who deny the struggle The triumphant overcome ...
I close my eyes and seize it I clench my fists and beat it I light my torch and burn it I am the beast I worship...  I am the beast I worship
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes Guillotine - yah
Sit in the dark and ponder how I'm fit to make the bottom fall through the floor And they all fall down - yah

To everything you want, ever did want We got it why not come get it, stick your head in that hole And watch me drop this cold guillotine death sentence - yah
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...  Guillotine - yah
Hidden art, between and beneath, every fragmented, figure of speech, Tongue in reverse, whenever the beat, causes my jaws to call Out out out out - yah
The screens flashing red, can't see shit but heads Spinning exorcist like planets Out of orbit off the edge Off mine axis whipping through doors to far more than all that’s ever been said - yah
Tie the chord kick the chair and your dead - yah
Yah ... guillotine - yah ... guillotine - yah
Head of a trick in a bucket Body of a trick in a bag And thrown in the fire like fuck it Gotta burn it before it goes bad One too many times been disgusted By the stench of rot is such a drag - yah

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...  Guillotine - yah
Serial number, killing machine The illest of means, To an end built on the filthy sound you're experiencing - yah
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...  Guillotine - yah
Tinted windows, bulletproof The slip knot fixin rope to noose To the grave stone grinder of cold steel
The passion that blinds me so I feel - YAH
Can't let go, no it flows through our veins Blows through our tunnels and rattles our chains And they all fall down - yah I fuck the music I make it cum I fuck the music with my serpent tongue
Wanna beer, have no fear, comes and goes, man its here No one knows, feels so weird, when it blows through my bones I got a jones for it I wanna know more, cuz its bout what I got to show for it
I want some more of it I want too much I got so bored with it I shot it up Wanna light my torch with it and get all fucked up
What is it, where is it How will it affect me Fuck that shit, I need that shits bound to be the death of me Fuck buying it I'm taking it, and sharing it with nobody
Cuz all I really need is some cool shit to mob Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job
I own that shit On some throw back shit You already know that shit You even know 'bout how I know the man Who grows that, bitch …
You can't buy it with your money You can't find it overseas Its one of those things that seems outlandish Til you have it's not a dream As for me, I'm cool with it And that's alright cuz it's my thing.
Work that angle til its beveled Curve of the blade doubled Edge made to bleed the struggle Best believe the game's a hustle.  Observer of the strange occurrences Conjurer of the subtle Unseen but felt disturbances That burst a bitches bubble
That’s right it's all mine It’s all mine never was yours Like how you wait in line
While I walk straight through the door (straight through the...) Hear you say something But ain't nothing – spectators ignored Pay no mind to that chump's Just a player hatin whore
I fuck the music I make it cum I fuck the music with my serpent tongue
Ain’t no fun if the aliens can't have none
How I fuck it dirty How I make it twitch and scream How it screams oh baby hurt me Work me to the bone oh please How I bend the rhythm over And hit, hit, hit it on my knees Give, give, give it up I need it all the time Bleed it on the drop of a dime – down to pound it til it shines Moonlit lake of blood red wine Make no mistake, I makes it mine
Break shit down and make it grind To the groove used to align The cascading shades of jaded blues with these rhymes Nuclear steeze creeps and winds Through secrets behind and between Every time I scream
Shit is mine Its all mine All the time Shit is mine
What is it, where is it, how will it affect me Fuck that shit I need that shit
Thought you knew, thought you thought Thought you did but did not Come on through what you got Is it cool is it hot?
Check one two, man don't stop I'm not through black blood clot In my view like that twat Spread eagle cross the block
Need no ego to rock What we know just gets dropped How we keep shit on lock
Cuz all I really need is some cool shit to mod Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job
Shit is mine Its all mine All the time Shit is mine Into the flame, into the fire With no regard for a thing, fuck that I'm the lord of the game I rule this empire
Lord of the game Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt Cuz no one has came even close to the train Of thought we drop like neutron bombs from the tower
Control this and bang this, then watch it rise higher Than anything seen in your entire Life spent in chains, sonic live wire Electrified rain from the lips of the driver Whippin the wheel Flippin donuts to peel Out on the face of the base, where's my lighter?  Need it to kill one more and chill while I feel
It so much my gut burns like the tires Movin this movement of real shit inspired By all that has come before this and was done For the real ones packin real guns loaded with power Shower the slums with power from the war marching drums that have come to devour The weakness that runs when we come Fuckin cowards
When they tell you you must make it And you think hell no Got a bad feeling and can't shake it Hits so low
Lord of the game Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt Cuz no one has came even close to the train of thought We drop like neutron bombs from the tower 'Pon which we maintain Like soldiers of fame And fortune denied as to to get by without the Bullshit coming at me from all sides Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide Told me it was all good, but they lied
Don't wait to see whites of their eyes Death to everyone who does not recognize Wars never done, think it is you die
Where was I now Like I said before Hear someone knockin At my front door Who could it be, should I ignore The knockin or see what could be in store For me if I leave the safety of the shore So many options, so little time To do what I want 'fore the end of the line Places its blade in the small of my spine Is it paranoia, is it real?  How long can a man enjoy what he doesn't feel
When they ask if you can make it And you don't wanna go
When they tell you you must make it And you think hell no Got a bad feeling and can't shake it Hits so low
(Rather be stuck naked) Than waste my time like the last time And every time before that Don't waste my time even one more time When you know that shit is whack Don't make me remind of you of the last time you Said you’d never go back.
Fuck where you're from, Fuck where you're goin, It's all about where you're at Triple six, five, forked tongue Subatomic penetration rapid fire through your skull How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose control Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it - Takyon Alright that’s tight, what its like to experience - Takyon
Out of the blue, in through the back Door coming through like fuck what was that Man I don’t know, but it made me feel so heated How we creep without showing you jack Shit from below, give a shit if you know Cuz even if you did, you’d keep coming back Back for more, need it man you're addicted to the heat We make beats catch Beat it til it bleeds to death, each track Like EPMD snappin necks as we tap energy from everything on and off the map
Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon Alright that’s tight what its like to experience - Takyon 
Takyon, shot down your throat like a keg of beer Choke on the smoke we in and exhale til the whole chamber is clear Haters act so fucking weird Try to stain this atmosphere But they can't cuz its way too sheer How to make a hater disappear
Take shit where it ain’t never been Fuck what you thought could not comprehend This shit if I fisted your brain with it 10-9-8-7-triple 6-5-forked tongue Criminal level crunk lightning storm Get out the way or get up torn Ain’t a picture big enough to fit What we dig up from the core Of all that they forgot ever was Militant march of this war
Takyon - taking them down All we see is blood Takyon - turning them out How to trick out and freak that buzz
Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon Alright that’s tight what its like to experience - Takyon 
Lunar eclipse forcing you to trip Off the moonlit fire we spray Cryonic haunted bullets hollow tipped with toxic waste So here’s the deal, if you don’t feel ill Don’t want it nowhere near my zone That shit is dead, can't nobody get With that shit gets dial toned
Takyon - bitch slappin pussy clots and clones Takyon - settin off unibombs inside your dome

Six feet deep below the street So they can't never say shit again Fuck the man with a thick broomstick And put a black flag on the end
Got to watch my back or just like that I’m bound to get locked up The law's watching me, constantly Too close and way too much Looking over my shoulder and checking in the rear view mirror Cuz I'm never not but a moment from getting taken to jail
They're knocking at my door, down my door They're shining lights in my eyes Exactly what do they stand for Ever asking more of I man why Like it matters why I chose to ignore All the laws I've been told to abide
Think I’m on parole, thinking I just stole Some shit you got an A.P.B out on but no You're wrong as usual hell no it wasn't me Have the nerve to ask me if I'm drunk when I’m pissing in the middle of the street
Looking over my shoulder...
By the way why they always acting Like they know how to size me up Ignorant bastards coming after me All the time on mine had enough.  Why they always wanna hassle me, pigs all up on my nuts Like they have to be, like I can't see em Trying to play shade tree in the cuts
By robbing me of my dignity So in the end I never say much But ain’t a time pass I don’t wish I could flash On penelope like fuck!

Shiva slashin through your flat screen Is nowhere for you to hide Strangled by anaconda thumbs to the soundtrack of world genocide My thoughts tie knots in silver spoons Vampire on the rise Punk a chump wit a cunt for brains platoon In the zone and on the grind
Dead matter disposer from the mountains without peaks Catch and release Time released horse capsule swallowed to wake the savage beast

Can't imagine whats fit to happen When I get to flashing, see the small Shrink to a fraction of what their lacking And less than that in no time at all.  Can't believe they have the gaul To try and act like they’re not trapped Between these walls ...
Bring it, bring it, bring it, kill it

Sometimes feel like I'm close but never get there NEVER GET THERE Does it mean I'm a ghost if I'm still here?  WANNA LEAVE HERE And if I am why can't I just float through the walls?  THROUGH THE WALLS And if I can, were they even ever there at all?  NOT AT ALL
Too much time spent in the maze will drive you mad, I feel so bad Been there so long I can't remember who I am, or where I stand But in the end I guess I just don’t give a damn Twist a gram and keep on sticking with the original plan Fuck it man
Judge you no more than I wish to be judged Even on the low But I do know what you do not speak of Don’t know but it shows Try to hide but I see who you are because I just know Keep talking but you already said too much There you go

Bring it, bring that shit heated Sling it, bring back that shit - kill it
See my blood spill drip, by chances Try to chill, quit, cuz I can't just slip into a zagthoth trance Tongue hissing, serpent chants Come again work it in, yeah just like that
We paint our insides black As the shadows 'hind our flesh And make all that we lack The part of life that we forget All praise due to the fact That we've forgotten how to sweat it Check it Bring it KILL IT
On everything I own Swear would rather slit my throat and die on the run Than be the one who ends up hangin from that rope Tied to the thumb of the man who comes to empty your pockets when you choke Got to get that shit myself and get the fuck out of this game Before I end up getting stuck with no one but myself to blame All the way insane

Can't predict me with them petty such a pity My peak keeps rising, they keep sinking Into lakes they're crying, I keep spitting Wish I could see them dying, but my peaks too fucking misty Tilt your lump, till back of your brains 'tween your weak slumped shoulder blades
Still can't scope peak I pave into one way street to space Grovel in gravel at my base, while saddle control you seek This world of cattle at my feet, born to get put back to sleep At my feet, born to get put back to sleep

I pull my face out the dirt slow These days I only wake up third of the way, narco Held to deep rapid eye move, hold These days I recede, rapid I reload Gun my chances closed road, no road left to travel
I know what this calls for, where's my scalpel? Operation cut Like I'm bored, sew my inner war up like corn rows My internal war blows like freezing fog in Oslo, frozen I can't get soft, baptized in hoar frost Like carbon monoxide garage, freeze your blink with sandman's flush
I hate you so much, I hate your laws I hate your need a cause, I hate your faux touch I hate every last one of you, I ponder digesting razors Just to be done with you, I love you so much
I'm triple the motherfucker Mondo fisted, full of backwards From bananatown manor My slang step like legless lizard I fuck around, fashion a rocket Shoot to Mercury, for the winter Extended vacation till I decompose on my splinters

Centuries of damn I've never been so yawn Can't believe I'm still standing Can't believe life take this long I stagger off to find my lighter I don't return until the day Sag A* validates mankind's destiny in a worm
By the way, I don't pet bleachers Court side to nose bleeders Like I shoot shit with gimps No response, lose 'em once Incoming second attempt To be real, I just shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em Them clueless strut nailed to crucifix Lilith shoved up her cunt, shoved up her cunt
Fuck
I pull my face out the dirt slow These days I only wake up third of the way, narco Held to deep rapid eye move, hold These days I recede, rapid I reload Gun my chances closed road, no road
I pull my face out the dirt slow These days I only wake up third of the way, narco Held to deep rapid eye move, hold These days I recede, rapid I reload Gun my chances closed road, no road left to travel I'm fucking tired of all the perks I've tried nothing, everything works
For less I'm worth, I've served my bid All fuck life wasn't what it is All fuck life was just a bridge I seen some free landed some tricks Far I see high time man quit Won't let you know when I get goin' Phone ring too long
Phone ring too long, I'm probably gone Ring tone jingle my swan song I'll show you how to leave well enough alone I'm not this world this on cue world I fall back, concoct new worlds I fall out in throbbing swirls I fall until I stop this world I fall the fuck off this world
I live down the street from you've noticed me, I've never seen you Wonder what the fuck I do Listen up, you nosy bitch, listen close My most recent purchase, old black rope Gonna learn how to tie it, hang it in my chamber Perfect reminder, occult I'm made of Come try it out whenever you wanna
Last night, 3:30 in the morning, Death on my front porch Can feel him itching to take me with him, hail death, fuck you waiting for?  Like a question no one mention, he turns around, hands me his weapon He slurs, "Use at your discretion, it's been a pleasure, Stefan"
Head on like dead, on like grey Death in your way, not in my way, I got my way I was in my way, crept out my way, kept out my way I'm on one like bae, you're on your way Way, way, way
Head on like dead, on like grey Death in your way, not in my way, I got my way I was in my way, crept out my way, kept out my way I'm on one like bae, you're on your way Way, way, way

Don't you worry, impossible for anything to be a big deal I'm in no weary, my vital post dated but clearly been ages since life had appeal Far more than fascination, my second nature chant kill 'cause I can This body by my own hands, my friends and family won't understand
So I stay in the end, don't make none to me If wasn't for them, I'd make that decision on GP Had to do it all again, I'd make that decision on GP
All the nights I don't die for you Wouldn't believe how many nights I ain't died for you on GP Not that I care, I'd be a liar if I sat here claiming I'd exit in a minute But I can't say I wouldn't I have my limits
